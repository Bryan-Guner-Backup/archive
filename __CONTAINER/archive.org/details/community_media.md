DESCRIPTION

The Community Media Archive gathers the diverse local TV and radio programs created through community access - including local non-commercial television channels on cable television systems serving a wide range of Public, Education and Government (PEG) purposes.

Thousands of community groups and over one million volunteer producers, directors, presenters and technical staff participate in PEG access production annually. These efforts result in more than 20,000 hours of new local programming each week!

Programs in this Collection are shared from Community Media Centers around the country (Do It Yourself Archiving) or collected from their Youtube or Vimeo channels (Archiving As a Service).

If you're interested in finding out more about the Community Media Archive or contributing video to it, contact [John Hauser](mailto:john@accesshumboldt.net)
