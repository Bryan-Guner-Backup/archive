The Computer Magazine Archives
==============================

With the re-branding of computing power and machines as something welcome in the home and not just the workshop, a number of factors moved forth to sell these machines and their software to a growing and large group of customers. Besides the introduction of more elegant cases and an increased presence by larger and larger firms, a strong argument can be made that one of the forces was the proliferation of computer-related magazines and newsletters that gave a central, printed home for writing ab...

Byte magazine was a microcomputer magazine, influential in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s because of its wide-ranging editorial coverage. Whereas many magazines from the mid-1980s had been dedicated to the MS-DOS (PC) platform or the Mac, mostly from a business or home user's perspective, Byte covered developments in the entire field of "small computers and software", and sometimes other computing fields such as supercomputers and high-reliability computing.

From Wikipedia: Compute! (ISSN 0194-357X) was an American computer magazine that was published from 1979 to 1994, though it can trace its origin to 1978 in Len Lindsay's PET Gazette, one of the first magazines for the Commodore PET computer. In its 1980s heyday Compute! covered all major platforms, and several single-platform spinoffs of the magazine were launched. The most successful of these was Compute!'s Gazette, catering to Commodore computer users. The magazine's original goal was to...

Creative Computing was one of the earliest magazines covering the microcomputer revolution. Published from October 1974 until December 1985, Creative Computing covered the whole spectrum of hobbyist/home/personal computing in a more accessible format than the rather technically oriented BYTE. The magazine was founded by David H. Ahl, who sold it to Ziff-Davis in the early 1980s, but remained as Editor-in-Chief. Featured writers included Robert Swirsky, David Lubar, and John J. Anderson.

It is with great regret that I have to inform you that the October 1998 issue of CU Amiga will be the last ever published. CU Amiga Magazine recently dipped into a state of unprofitability, from which it looked unlikely to emerge. The decision to close the magazine was taken by EMAP in light of the magazine's overall financial performance and the lack of prospects for any immediate or short term recovery. It is ironic that CU Amiga should close as the world's best selling Amiga magazine, but...

It went through several phases; at first, it was very much a hobbyist magazine, with plenty of type-ins and technical articles. Like most 80's UK computer magazines, it went a bit mad as the market got saturated and relaunched as an entertainment title, with some bizarre and ill-fitting Jerry Paris cartoon characters...

Natuurlijk moest die typebeschrijving worden aangevuld met achtergrondinformatie over de werking van de IC's en voorbeeldschakelingen. Dat handboek...

DESCRIPTION

With the re-branding of computing power and machines as something welcome in the home and not just the workshop, a number of factors moved forth to sell these machines and their software to a growing and large group of customers. Besides the introduction of more elegant cases and an increased presence by larger and larger firms, a strong argument can be made that one of the forces was the proliferation of computer-related magazines and newsletters that gave a central, printed home for writing about computers. Rising from user support groups, computer companies themselves, and publishing houses willing to risk cash and time to fund them, these magazines set the stage for the home computer revolution.

This collection consists of dozens of magazine runs, digitized from fading piles of older magazines by an army of anonymous contributors. In some cases, quality is variant, due to the rareness of the issues. Special thanks and recognition are given to sites bombjack.org, atarimagazines.com.

**This collection is primarily of computer magazines written in the english language. There are additional collections in other languages: [Spanish-language computer magazines](http://www.archive.org/details/computermagazinesspanish). There are also collections of [gaming magazines](http://www.archive.org/details/gamemagazines) and [computer-related newsletters](http://www.archive.org/details/computernewsletters).**
