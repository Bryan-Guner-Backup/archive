DESCRIPTION

The JSTOR Early Journal Content is a selection of journal materials published prior to 1923 in the United States and prior to 1870 elsewhere. It includes discourse and scholarship in the arts and humanities, economics and politics, and in mathematics and other sciences - nearly 500,000 articles from more than 200 journals. It was uploaded to the Internet Archive in 2013.

JSTOR Early Journal Content has been freely available at [www.jstor.org](http://www.jstor.org) since September 2011. Early Journal Content is updated regularly on JSTOR as new material from the relevant time period is digitized and added to JSTOR. JSTOR also makes an Early Journal Content data bundle freely available for text mining and analysis. It includes full-text OCR and article and title-level metadata and may be downloaded from the [JSTOR Data for Research site](http://dfr.jstor.org/?view=text&helpview=about_ejc).
