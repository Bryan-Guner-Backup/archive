people in congress, there's senator amy klobuchar now saying this, for instance, about ending the filibuster. &gt;&gt; i believe we should abolish the filibuster. i do not believe in archaic rule should be used to allow us to put our heads in the sand to use justice sotomayor's words to put our heads in the sand and not take action on the important issues. &gt;&gt; what are democrats going to do? they're pissed off, right? nothing like ticking them off with something like this and that's going to translate, they would think, and they're going to try to optimize that to votes. &gt;&gt; yeah. and what you're speaking to is i think a real political miscalculation by republicans to do this right before midterms. you're taking away a huge wedge issue. you're mobilizing democrats at a time where believe me they need to be mobilized, right? we know these mid term elections

democratic state rep. dawnna dukes challenged white's allegations and unexpectedly revealed she, too, had had an abortion. this is part of their exchange, beginning with rep. dukes. &gt;&gt; and i know for a fact that one who has an abortion does not have alcohol and drug-related issues. that is a personality type that should have got some psychological treatment. \[applause\] &gt;&gt; i would definitely like to respond to that. unless you've had your own abortion, you cannot tell a woman what she feels. &gt;&gt; well, you know what? &gt;&gt; if it is a personality disorder -- hold on, i am speaking. &gt;&gt; ok, fine.
