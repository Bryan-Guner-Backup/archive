With the re-branding of computing power and machines as something welcome in the home and not just the workshop, a number of factors moved forth to sell these machines and their software to a growing and large group of customers.

The "ideal" for the Internet Archive system is one readable texts item per identifier. However, some users are known to upload entire collections of a given series rather than go through the trouble of making so many individual items. To help make them more readable, copies will be brought into the Archive's stacks, but the original items will still remain. This collection consists of these "mega-pack" items, contributed over years by users.

The Smythe character was referred to as Cracked's janitor. Unlike Neuman, who appears primarily on covers, Smythe sometimes spoke and was...

It is with great regret that I have to inform you that the October 1998 issue of CU Amiga will be the last ever published. CU Amiga Magazine recently dipped into a state of unprofitability, from which it looked unlikely to emerge.

It is ironic that CU Amiga should close as the world's best selling Amiga magazine, but...

It went through several phases; at first, it was very much a hobbyist magazine, with plenty of type-ins and technical articles.
