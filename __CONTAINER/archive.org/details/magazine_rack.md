The "ideal" for the Internet Archive system is one readable texts item per identifier. However, some users are known to upload entire collections of a given series rather than go through the trouble of making so many individual items. To help make them more readable, copies will be brought into the Archive's stacks, but the original items will still remain. This collection consists of these "mega-pack" items, contributed over years by users.

It is with great regret that I have to inform you that the October 1998 issue of CU Amiga will be the last ever published. CU Amiga Magazine recently dipped into a state of unprofitability, from which it looked unlikely to emerge. The decision to close the magazine was taken by EMAP in light of the magazine's overall financial performance and the lack of prospects for any immediate or short term recovery. It is ironic that CU Amiga should close as the world's best selling Amiga magazine, but...

Computer and Video Games Magazine Issues 01-126 (November 1981 - May 1992) plus Yearbooks. Computer and Video Games (C+VG) was a long-running multi-format UK-based magazine. It went through several phases; at first, it was very much a hobbyist magazine, with plenty of type-ins and technical articles. Like most 80's UK computer magazines, it went a bit mad as the market got saturated and relaunched as an entertainment title, with some bizarre and ill-fitting Jerry Paris cartoon characters...
