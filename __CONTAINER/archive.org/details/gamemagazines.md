DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of magazines and newsletters based around gaming of all sorts: Arcade games, Computer Games, Console Games, as well as Board Games, Role-Playing Games, and any other sort of related entertainment.

This collection consists of dozens of magazine runs, digitized from fading piles of older magazines by an army of anonymous contributors. In some cases, quality is variant, due to the rareness of the issues. Special thanks and recognition are given to sites bombjack.org, atarimagazines.com.

**This collection is primarily of game magazines written in the english language. There are additional collections in other languages: [Spanish-language computer magazines](http://www.archive.org/details/computermagazinesspanish). Be sure to also check the [computer magazines](http://www.archive.org/details/computermagazines) and [computer newsletters](http://www.archive.org/details/computernewsletters) sections.**
